# EmailResponder
A app that connects to a gmail account and automatically responds to dealing with recruiter emails.

What the app does:
Based on keywords on incoming email it will do one or more of the following.

- Respond to the email.
- Delete the email.
- Leave the email untouched for me to manually deal with it 


To make sure your app works, change the following settings:

- Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security?pli=1#connectedapps

- go to the section 'Less secure app access'

- Change 'Allow less secure apps:' to ON

TODO:
- move keywords to a properties file rather than hard coding them.
